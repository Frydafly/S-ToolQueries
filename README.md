# S-ToolQueries
SQL Queries for the Voter File S tool

This repo provides sample queries for frequently asked questions
related to demographic and voter file data that come up in my job 
as a data manager for nonprofit civic engagement organizations.

Queries are written in SQL and pull data from a private database.
